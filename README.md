Animated Splash Screen:
The app starts with an engaging splash screen animation to create a smooth first impression for users.

Google Fit Integration:
It pulls real-time data from Google Fit, including step count and calories burned (in kilocalories), and displays them on the home screen.

Smartwatch Support:
Users can see data synced from their connected Google Fit-compatible smartwatches.

Dark Mode Support:
The app automatically switches to dark mode based on the system theme (system default), ensuring all screens (splash screen and home screen) follow the dark mode design.

State Management with GetX:
The entire app uses GetX for state management, navigation, and reactivity, with the project set up using the GetX CLI tool for clean architecture and scalability.
